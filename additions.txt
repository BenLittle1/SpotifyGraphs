Charge Strength - Controls node repulsion (tight ↔ spread)
Node Size - Scales all node sizes (small ↔ large)
Link Opacity - Controls connection visibility (faint ↔ strong)
Link Distance - Controls connection lengths (compact ↔ loose)
Orbital Distance - Controls radial positioning (close ↔ far)
Gravity - Controls centering force (weak ↔ strong)
